# CoolDude-OS
CoolDude OS is a fun project I made that mimics an operating system that you can play in your browser. 

Once I learn other programming languages for building applications, not websites, then I may remake CoolDude OS as an actual operating system.

## Web operating system
Play it at https://jeffreymaniac.github.io/CoolDude-OS.

The web technolgies used are:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

It is all in one page, so you won't have to go to other pages. Your data is saved in local browser storage, so if you don't want your data lost, then don't clear your cache for this site in particular.
